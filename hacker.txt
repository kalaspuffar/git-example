The Boston Globe in 1984 defined "hackers" as "computer nuts".[18] In their programmer subculture, 
a hacker is a person who follows a spirit of playful cleverness and loves programming. It is found 
in an originally academic movement unrelated to computer security and most visibly associated with 
free software, open source and demoscene. It also has a hacker ethic, based on the idea that writing 
software and sharing the result on a voluntary basis is a good idea, and that information should be 
free, but that it's not up to the hacker to make it free by breaking into private computer systems. 
This hacker ethic was publicized and perhaps originated in Steven Levy's Hackers: Heroes of the Computer 
Revolution (1984). It contains a codification of its principles.
